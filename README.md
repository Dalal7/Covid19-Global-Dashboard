# Covid19-Global-Dashboard

## Summary
The purpose of this project is to analyze the COVID-19 global data. I collected the dataset from COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, then cleaning and processing them using the python script. After that, I built a dashboard using Power BI to show the summary statistics, trends, and forecasts of COVID-19 around the world.

## Project files
1- ```COVID_19_Data_Processing.ipynb```: This script is used to pull the updated dataset, clean them and then write them as a CSV file. </br>
2- ```COVID_19_Dashboard.pbix```: This is the Power BI file that I used to design the dashboard.
